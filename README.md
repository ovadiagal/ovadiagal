### Hi, I'm Gal 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!
I am a senior at Georgia Tech studying computer science. My concentrations are in [Systems/Architectures](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/systems-architecture) and [Information Internetworks](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/information-internetworks).

Some things I do outside of school:
- I was the head TA for [Computer Organization](https://github.com/gt-cs2110), so I can draw the [LC-3 datapath](https://www.google.com/search?q=lc-3+datapath&udm=2) from memory 👾
- I am a member of the [Ramblin' Reck Club](https://reckclub.org/), Georgia Tech's student spirit and traditions club 🚗
- In another life I am a chef instead of a software engineer 👨‍🍳
