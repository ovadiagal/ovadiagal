### Hi, I'm Gal ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!
I am a senior at Georgia Tech studying computer science. My concentrations are in [Systems/Architectures](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/systems-architecture) and [Information Internetworks](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/information-internetworks).

Some things I do outside of school:
- I was the head TA for [Computer Organization](https://github.com/gt-cs2110), so I can draw the LC-3 datapath from memory 
- I am a member of the Ramblin' Reck Club, Georgia Tech's student spirit and traditions club. Check us out [here](https://reckclub.org/)!
- I've previously interned at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/), [Pery](https://www.mypery.com/about), and [Thetaray](https://www.thetaray.com/).
